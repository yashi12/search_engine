It includes 8 major topics - soil chemistry, soil mineralogy, soil organic matter, soil physics, soil biology, soil fertility, soil nutrient management, soil genesis & classification. This course will provide a basic understanding of all the key concepts and terminologies of every aspect of soil.Case Studies in Data Mining was originally taught as three separate online data mining courses. We examine three case studies which together present a broad-based tour of the basic and extended tasks of data mining in three different domains: (1) predicting algae blooms; (2) detecting fraudulent sales transactions; and (3) predicting stock market returns. The cumulative ""hands-on"" 3-course fifteen sessions showcase the use of Luis Torgo\'s amazingly useful ""Data Mining with R"" (DMwR) package and R software. Everything that you see on-screen is included with the course: all of the R scripts; all of the data files and R objects used and/or referenced; as well as all of the R packages\' documentation. You can be new to R software and/or to data mining and be successful in completing the course. The first case study, Predicting Algae Blooms, provides instruction regarding the many useful, unique data mining functions contained in the R software \'DMwR\' package. For the algae blooms prediction case, we specifically look at the tasks of data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive model construction. For individuals completely new to R, the first two sessions of the algae blooms case (almost 4 hours of video and materials) provide an accelerated introduction to the use of R and RStudio and to basic techniques for inputting and outputting data and text. is the second extended data mining case study that showcases the DMwR (Data Mining with R) package. The case is specific but may be generalized to a common business problem: How does one sift through mountains of data (401,124 records, in this case) and identify suspicious data entries, or ""outliers""? The case problem is very unstructured, and walks through a wide variety of approaches and techniques in the attempt to discriminate the ""normal"", or ""ok"" transactions, from the abnormal, suspicious, or ""fraudulent"" transactions. This case presents a large number of alternative modeling approaches, some of which are appropriate for supervised, some for unsupervised, and some for semi-supervised data scenarios. The third extended case, is a data mining case study addressing the domain of automatic stock trading systems. These four sessions address the tasks of building an automated stock trading system based on prediction models that utilize daily stock quote data. The goal is to predict future returns for the S&P 500 market index. The resulting predictions are used together with a trading strategy to make decisions about generating market buy and sell orders. The case examines prediction problems that stem from the time ordering among data observations, that is, from the use of data. It also exemplifies the difficulties involved in translating model predictions into decisions and actions in the context of \'real-world\' business applications.In this course you have to learn about varieties of plants which is very much helpful for human beings, birds and animals.

Whereas throughout most of martial arts history the bottom player was always losing BJJ showed that you could win from there. While, this certainly should not be a goal (getting to bottom) we should learn what to do once there.For many of us who are studying Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu there is a dilemma.

To conclude, the specialization moves into implementation of neurohacking using the R programming language, with the associated packages to perform data manipulation, processing, and analysis of neuroimaging data, using publicly available structural MRI.']","['Learn about fMRI data design, structure and acquisition.Familiarize yourself with fMRI Artifacts and types of noise.Learn how to read/write images of the brain in NIfTI format.Learn about Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy.']",['']

First we learn about Desktop Automation & Robotics Process Automation (RPA).  We take our first steps learning how to program in AutoHotkey.  This course is for non-programmers that want to learn how to use this free (open source) tool!Robotics Process Automation is a BOOMING field.  Most other tools (UIPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism, etc.) cost $10,000 plus per license while AutoHotkey is free!  What's really great about AutoHotkey is that after you write a script, you can share it by right-clicking the script and compiling it.  In about 2 seconds you have an executable that will run on most Windows computers (Windows XP, 7, 8 and 10)This course covers the basics and is designed for non-programmers wanting to automate the mundane with AutoHotkeysLearn AutoHotKey the easy way. If you've ever wanted to automate a simple or complex task on a Windows computer in this course you'll learn how to do so.If you've ever had to do the same thing repetitively on a computer whether it's filling a form, or using the same commands in your favorite software AutoHotKey can save your time and spare you from the boredom of the most tedious parts of a job.In this lesson we'll use entirely free open source software tools to accomplish your goal of automating Windows programs. I'll take you through installation, common commands and then writing a simple but sophisticated program to give you the knowledge you need to write your own code.To complete this course you won't need any programming experience or purchase any software, as long as you have a Windows computer and enthusiasm you can be successful with AutoHotkey.AutoHotKey (AHK) is probably one of the best Windows tools out there.It is easy to set up, easy to customize to your specific needs, and has the potential to save you hundreds of working hours in a year. Oh, and did I mention that it is free?In this course, I will introduce you to writing your own AHK scripts. Within one hour, you will be ready to run scripts that will be huge time savers already. And if you are an AHK enthusiast by then, I will give you some more input and food for thought to make your practice even more productive. But really - with the help of this course, you will not need more than an hour to cover the basics and start saving time.Within this hour, you will start creating your first hotkeys, hotstrings (extremely handy text replacements), and even you very own application with graphical user interface.

On top of that, they are incompatible with each other. Because of that, scientists become hostage of the manufacturers of scientific equipment: if they buy an analyzer, they need to buy the autosampler from the same seller, even if they know a better autosample made by a different manufacturer.In this course this changes. By learning AutoIt for laboratory automation, you will see how easy it is to integrate scientific equipment made by different manufacturers. This includes open-source hardware, which is made by scientists to scientists, and cost a fraction of commercial devices.Learn AutoIt and become a more versatile professional.

This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.Implement mathematical concepts using real-world dataDerive PCA from a projection perspectiveUnderstand how orthogonal projections workMaster PCAUnderstand and use the fundamentals of the SAS programming languageAccess different types of data (SAS, Excel, or text),      then explore and prepare the data Analyze and report on data and export results to common      formats (HTML, PDF, Excel)       Apply SAS programming principles in practical examplesWhen you complete the SAS® Base Programming courses, you will have demonstrated skills in manipulating and transforming data, combining SAS data sets, creating basic detail and summary reports using SAS procedures and identifying and correcting data, syntax and programming logic errors.

Products have become complex and engineers are more frequently asked to leave specialized roles and to take on a wide variety of tasks that are beyond their traditional responsibilities.  These tasks are centered on form, fit, and function. Engineers need to factor in broader concerns such as cost, procurement, sustainability, manufacturability, and serviceability. Their role has moved away from an individual responsibility to working as part of a collaborative engineering team, executing tradeoffs with both engineering and business stakeholders to meet project goals. These trends have forced today’s engineers to broaden their skillset to be successful. Engineers today are required to be on the cutting edge of design innovation. This means not only understanding engineering principles that govern the title and role, but also perfecting the toolsets needed to design and develop products.

While they can behave very differently at times, there’s actually a lot of similarities when it comes to training these animals to behave appropriately within a human family.There are just a handful of issues that make up nearly all of the problems that people have with their pet dogs and cats. This means that these problems are very predictable, and fortunately, they’re also very preventable. And that’s probably the biggest similarity of all. When it comes to behavior problems, whether the pet is a cat or a dog, the easiest, most effective and most efficient approach is prevention. The key is to do as much training as possible, as early as possible.We know what the problems are going to be, we know how to prevent them, and if we prevent the problems, they never form into bad habits. Once a problem has become a habit, it's significantly harder to fix. The treatment is going to use nearly identical methods, it’s just going to take much longer than prevention would have.""]",[''],"['Motivation to enrich your cat’s lifeStudents must be interest towards learning new techniques to solve math problems easily, accurately and quicklyStudent must have Zeal to stay out of the Crowd and Succeed in the Competitive ExamsThere are no prerequisites for this course']"

You’ll get to see all it offers, such as the simplified syntax compared to JavaScript, the impressive build tools, and the possibilities to simplify your project structure.You'll build an application while learning the specifics of the language and the many tricks CoffeeScript has up its sleeve. You will use JavaScript libraries to avoid ‘reinventing the wheel’, while inventing some wheels of our own in order to better understand some advanced concepts . We'll go through a really simple MVC framework that provides the basis of a simple document editing application that can export documents to the desktop (from the Web).In this course we examine several technologies. The first is Grunt. Grunt is a task runner which is a way for us to implement a build system to handle writing our code in different languages, preprocessing, minifying our code, and doing unit testing -- all automated. We’ll also take a look at Coffeescript, which is a preprocessor for Javascript. It follows a lot of similar structures to Python and is very, very popular.Finally, we’ll discuss Sockets. Sockets are a way for us to open a constant connection between the server and the client. Normally when you make a request, the request goes up and then comes down with the data. With a socket, that request goes up and stays open, allowing the server to send data whenever it wants and the client to send data whenever it wants.So, we can make real time applications using sockets and we’ll take a look at how to implement a very simple system using socket IO.""]",[''],"['Basic knowledge of JavaScriptPerforming web application developmentThis course covers the fundamentals of CoffeeScript with real-world examples and provides a practical step-by-step approach to building a web app. The course brushes up the basics, bringing you up to speed with all the essentials to building an app, and then dives in to creating the app and publishing it.Introduction to JavaScript DevelopmentIntermediate JavaScript DevelopmentIntroduction to Node.js DevelopmentAdvanced JavaScript DevelopmentAdvanced Node.js Development']"

These programs vary widely but most share a concern for five individual, student competencies: self awareness; self-management; social awareness; relationship skills; and finally responsible decision making. It is important for teachers and parents to know about and understand these programs. While lots of SEL programs emphasize K-12 student social and emotional learning, only a very few programs exist to promote, and help teachers explore their own emotional well-being. In this Specialization our central premise is this:To facilitate students’ social and emotional learning, a teacher must know the student as a person. This means that the teacher must strive to know her or him self. In order to help students achieve a degree of well-being, teachers need to be aware of their own well-being.In our Specialization, “The Teacher and SEL” the instructors (Randy Testa and Dan Liston, as well as Emily Price and Ben Kirshner) examine kindergarten through high school SEL programs, looking at both established programs and less well-known community-based and youth empowerment approaches. Along with this examination of K-12 SEL programs, we bring a much needed emphasis on the teachers’ well being.""]",['Educate school staff in the science and impact of stressProvide school staff with the opportunity to build and apply social and emotional skills and strategiesOffer strategies for helping students to identify and manage their emotionsProvide resources and ideas that are relevant during this time of heightened stress and uncertainty'],['PC or Mac with installed Affinity Designer appFamiliarity with End Game or my other courses may help but is not requiredYou must have a good computer with built-in webcam (or an external webcam).You must have a strong internet connection.']

It\'s like having your own professional guide with you on the water. Makes a great gift for a new fly fisher!I have loved fishing for my entire life, but I didn\'t know how to fly fish. All I knew was that people who were fly fishing always caught more fish than me and it drove me crazy. When I was 12 years old I got my first Fly Rod (the WalMart Special) and after spending hours online and on YouTube I discovered that there was far too much scattered information and the videos on YouTube were too disconnected to make sense of as a whole.The Fly Rod went into storage for almost a decade. When I moved next to a Blue Ribbon River (in other words a really good fly fishing river) a few years later I decided that I was going to tackle it once and for all. I went out on the river all by myself, every day, for three weeks straight and didn\'t catch a single thing! I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Finally I ran into a few guides on the river who were kind enough to show me some basics and I have been fly fishing ever since.Learn how to build a profitable business you can sell.

In this course I'll take you from novice to ninja in Vue JS 3, starting out with the very basics and then moving on towards creating fully-fledged Vue applications. We'll spend a whole chapter learning about the Vue Router - and how to create SPA's (single page applications) using it - as well as exploring how to use the Vue CLI to get up and running quickly when creating slightly larger Vue applications.We'll also dive deep into the newest features Vue 3 has to offer, including a lot about the Composition API & Composable Functions.I'll also teach you how to use Firebase - an online & free service provided by Google which will act as a feature-rich back-end to our Vue applications. We'll learn how to use Firebase to store and retrieve real-time data to and from a NoSQL database called Firestore, as well as authenticate our app's users with the Firebase Auth service, We'll also take a peak at Firebase Storage (which will enable us to allow users to upload images on our Vue sites), as well as deploying all of our applications to Firebase hosting.If you are looking for the best backend to go along with Angular, or even better if you are looking to do as little server-side development as possible and focus mostly on the frontend, then look no further: Firebase is the right choice for you.With Firebase, you will be able to query your database directly from the client and even directly modify data straight from the client in a secure way. You might not think that this would even be possible and that there always has to be a server involved in order for things to be secure, and that is true.But that does not mean that you have to write the server yourself, and that is the whole point of the term Serverless. With Firebase you can write essentially serverless applications, in the sense that in the application code base there is hardly any server-side code at all when compared to a traditional REST-based application.Angular is one of the most popular front-end frameworks for building single-page applications or web apps with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. So basically, if you want to become a successful front-end or a full-stack developer, that get hired, you need to have Angular as a skill under your belt.\n\nLearning Angular 2 or Angular 4/5/6/7/8/9/10 or Angular 11 or simply Angular(as the Angular team likes to call it) on your own can be confusing or frustrating at times. It might require you to browse through several tutorials, articles, YouTube videos, etc, and get a grip on it.If you want to get rid of going through all that trouble and just focus on learning Angular, this is THE course for you.

Out of necessity, it does not cover all aspects of the language, but enough so that students will be able to write useful codes after completion.  The course  will be of particular value to those STEM students who would like to learn a language which has stood the test of time, and is widely used in the area of scientific computing.  Also useful for those who need to work with legacy Fortran code but have no Fortran background.  Previous programming experience would be helpful but is not absolutely necessary.  The course assumes some basic ability to use a command-line interface. I will also provide a short introduction to the use of DISLIN, a graphics/widget plotting package that you can implement in your Fortran codes. All Fortran codes used as examples are downloadable, as are the course notes.Learn one of the oldest programming languages. Fortran is still in common use for high-performance scientific and engineering applications. If you\'re new to programming, and especially if you\'re in a math, science or engineering field, this is a great course to get started with.We talk about getting your computer initially set up, programming fundamentals, including variables, looping and branching constructs, modules and derived types. We even go into some tips for growing and organizing your programs towards the end of the course.This course will cover the basics of the finite volume method for incompressible flows on two-dimensional Cartesian grids. Topics include the discretization procedure, interpolation techniques, boundary conditions, flow visualization using ParaView, and CFD errors and uncertainty.  Students will write three codes; the first code solves a pure diffusion problem, the second solves a pure convection problem, and the third solves the Navier-Stokes equations using the SIMPLE pressure-velocity coupling procedure.  The Navier-Stokes solver will be used to solve the ""driven cavity"" problem, and a problem involving the developing flow in a channel.  These three codes are also available for download to, for instance, study the solution procedure, or help in debugging a student written code.  Upon completion of the course students will be familiar with the basics of the finite volume method, enabling a more effective use of a commercial CFD solver, and possess the background necessary to study more advanced CFD techniques.Anyone new to programmingAnyone new to programmingAnyone new to programmingComputer programming in general and the MATLAB language in particular.Advanced MATLAB features such as the App Designer, Live Scripts and Object-Oriented Programming.Program efficiency and an introduction to algorithm complexity.Image processing, data visualization and an introduction to machine learning.This Specialization aims to take learners with little to no programming experience to being able to create MATLAB programs that solve real-world problems in engineering and the sciences.

The course content builds up from some very basic coding practices to complex interaction between client and database via a server. Although it was not expected that the exercises were completed I did indeed follow along and now have a fully-functional webapp that I can modify to suit my needs. For an introduction, this course covers an incredibly wide range of concepts covering not only the display and processing of spatial data but also some internet security measures and even a little history thrown in which makes it much easier to understand the possibilities and limitations of Web GIS. I am thoroughly looking forward to starting Michael\'s Leaflet course."" - Student Review on UdemyServer-side web GIS applications allow you to access GIS data stored in a multi-user database. This means that your data will always be current and any changes that other users make to the data will be immediately available in your application. You will be able to build complex GIS applications where some users will only be able to view certain data that you allow them and other users will be able to add, edit, and delete data from a web-interface. This means that your users will be able to interact with your GIS database from any device that has a compatible browser and an internet connection. They may be working in the field from a mobile device or from home on a mac OS computer, or on the other side of the world on a Linux computer.\n\nThis course uses PHP for the server-side language because of its popularity and its wide availability on web servers. We will use PostGIS as a spatial database, again because of its popularity and common usage in GIS applications. I teach standard web development methods that have stood the test of time and will still be available in many years after the latest, greatest, technology has been replaced with something even better. My goal as an instructor is to provide an introduction to the basic concepts. I don\'t think you will find any limitations with the software that I teach but if you ultimately decide to use a different server-side language, database, or a newer framework the methods you learn here will provide a solid foundation.Learn how to develop your own HTML5 GPS data collection applications that work like a native app on your mobile device.  While there are many canned options available for mobile data collection that may meet your needs, there are many times when it may be more cost-effective to develop your own.Cost - Even if your needs are simple many commercial applications require monthly per-user subscriptions, often in the neighborhood of $30-$50 per month. For 1 or 2 users that may not be much but with 50 users it quickly becomes cost effective to write your own.Customizability - Commercial ""non-programming"" solutions tend to be one-size fits all. Although they may have some flexibility, it is not uncommon for many applications to need functionality that is not available.  Writing your own mean that if you can envision it you can implement it. Often you can implement it faster than you could in a ""non-programming"" solution even if it is available.']",[''],"['This is an introductory level course.

You will then move on to learning writing expressions and high-order functions.At the end of the video, you will be able to build a complete application with Haskell alongwith learning the important functionalities.Haskell is a powerful, purely functional programming language that allows developers to express their designs elegantly and succinctly. Modern Haskell tools such as Cabal and Stack also allow developers to build and manage large and complex systems and to consume a vast array of high-quality open source libraries.First we will start this course by learning how to edit , build and test our Haskell code. Then we will learn how to create modules in Haskell. We will learn about the various Haskell repositories and how to use them.Once we have our Haskell package in place we will end by testing our package using third-party ecosystems.This course builds on the foundations provided by the Fundamentals of Practical Haskell Programming course and helps to bridge the gap between introductory and advanced Haskell by teaching you how to manage and develop complex programs.

This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.""]",['Implement mathematical concepts using real-world dataDerive PCA from a projection perspectiveUnderstand how orthogonal projections workMaster PCA'],['You must be able to download and install software on your computerNo pre-requisites.

In today's computer age, the ability to write code is becoming just as important as reading and writing.  From doing scientific work to manipulating data and creating applications and web resources, computer coding is everywhere.The Wolfram Language is an ideal candidate for your first language.  Even if you are seasoned in other languages, it is worthwhile to take a look at this powerful yet easy to learn language.  The structure of the language is such that once you understand a few basics, it becomes almost intuitive to guess at what new code should look like without having to explicitly learn it.  This sets it apart from so many other languages.The Wolfram Language is also unique in that it gives you access to information right inside of the coding environment.  It makes knowledge computable.  Through the Wolfram Language you will have access to an enormous amount of data and knowledge.This course is for anyone in the healthcare and life sciences interested in doing their own statistical analysis.  You will learn an easy to use, powerful computer language and how to use it to do statistical analysis.  The introduction shows you how to get a copy of Mathematica or how to use the free version in the cloud.  The Wolfram company also provides complimentary access to Wolfram|One for all students who take this course.  More information is available in the BONUS MATERIAL video lecture.Although the course assumes some knowledge of statistical concepts, it does supply enough information on the basics of statistics, so that most learners will find it a useful resource enough resource to learn these concepts, over and above learning how to write code to do the actual analysis.The course is made up of clearly defined sections, each with its own set of video lectures.  The first video in each section is accompanied by notebook files and, where required, a spreadsheet data file.  The notebook in each section marked  is a copy of the notebook that I use in the video lectures.  The other notebook file contains much more description of both the code and the statitics.

Following that, we will show, in both MEL and in Python, some of the more common functions in programming. The first are iterators, which allow us to perform the same task over lists of objects and comes in several forms. The second function common to all programming languages is the conditional statement, which allows us to test conditions before executing code and allowing us to branch the program depending on what conditions are met.

No other online course in Algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time — you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects: Big Networks and Genome Assembly. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.Apply basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting and dynamic programming to solve programming challenges.Apply various data structures such as stack, queue, hash table, priority queue, binary search tree, graph and string to solve programming challenges.Apply graph and string algorithms to solve real-world challenges: finding shortest paths on huge maps and assembling genomes from millions of pieces.Solve complex programming challenges using advanced techniques: maximum flow, linear programming, approximate algorithms, SAT-solvers, streaming.']","['Apply basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting and dynamic programming to solve programming challenges.Apply various data structures such as stack, queue, hash table, priority queue, binary search tree, graph and string to solve programming challenges.Apply graph and string algorithms to solve real-world challenges: finding shortest paths on huge maps and assembling genomes from millions of pieces.Solve complex programming challenges using advanced techniques: maximum flow, linear programming, approximate algorithms, SAT-solvers, streaming.']","['A good understanding of JavaScript & ES6 FundamentalsReact & Node BasicsBasic Understanding JavaScript or any other programming languageBasic Understanding of React JsBasic Understanding of Node JsBasic Knowledge with JavascriptBasic knowledge of React.Basic knowledge of React hooks is recommended.Basic knowledge of MongoDB, Express, and Node is recommended but not mandatory.']"

The next is either when our choice of database becomes a bottleneck or when we need to do large-scale data analytics.This course covers almost all classes of databases or data storage platform there are and when to consider using them. It is a great journey through databases that will be great for software developers, big data engineers, data analysts as well as decision makers. It is not an in-depth look into each of the databases but promises to get you up and running with your first project for each class.In this course, we are going to cover NoSQL (Non-SQL or Not-only-SQL) databases are increasing in popularity due to the growth of data as they can store non-relational data on a super large scale, and can solve problems regular databases can't handle. They are widely used in Big data operations. Their main advantage is the ability to handle large data sets  effectively  as well as scalability and flexibility issues for modern applications.

A well-designed syntax of your programming language is a big motivation why users would prefer and choose exactly your language.----------------------------------------------------------The problem with “parsers theory” in classic compiler schools and books is that this theory is often considered as “too advanced”, going right into complicated formal descriptions from the Theory of Computation and formal grammars. As a result students may lose an interest in building a compiler already at parsing stage.The opposite problem often seen in describing a parser is a superficial approach describing only manual (usually recursive descent) parsing, leaving the students with issues understanding the actual techniques behind the automated parsers.Parsing or syntactic analysis is one of the first stages in designing and implementing a compiler. A well-designed syntax of your programming language is a big motivation why users would prefer and choose exactly your language.Note: this is a practical class on building a manual Recursive-descent parser. If you’re interested in parsing theory and automated algorithms you may also consider the [ Parsing Algorithms ] class.Recursive descent parsers are the group of parsers which are widely used on practice in many production programming languages. In contrast with automated parsing algorithms, the manual implementation allows having full control over the parsing process, and handling complex constructs, which may not be possible in the automatic parsers.Besides, implementing a full manual parser from scratch allows understanding and seeing this process from inside, demystifying internal structures, and turning building parsers into an interesting engineering task.Install Python and write your first programDescribe the basics of the Python programming languageUse variables to store, retrieve and calculate informationUtilize core programming tools such as functions and loopsThis Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language.

As a result, their idea of leadership and how to lead is theoretical, based on learned concepts and studies. Leadership is practical and the best way to understand it is to study leaders and see how they lead, the strategies they use, the tactics they use, how they handle various situations and how and why they fail, deducing important lessons for own leadership. This gives a leader a better understanding of what leadership is and how to lead.In the course, over 20 of the world’s greatest Military Generals and Emperors of all time are profiled and studied, from Shaka Zulu, Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Genghis Khan to Commodus among others, giving the learner clear insights into what made these man standout as leaders and what made some to fail.

I\'ve been teaching chess for more than 15 years and mentored 3 junior players that became World Champions. I know exactly what material to teach you when you start learning about Endgames. Fundamental Principles such as Opposition, Zugzwang, Mined Squares are important to learn and master.In this course I recorded 16 Lessons that will help you establish Fundamental Endgame ideas. Every chess player must learn Endgames. World Champion J. R. Capablanca once said: "" This course is about pawn endgames. Sometimes pawn endgame seems to be equal: both sides have equal material. In this course I teach you how to use your king activeness, better pawn structure and reserve tempos forcing your opponent to worsen his position.If you are a strong chess player, you may know that deep calculation helps to win pawn endgames, and I would agree with you. But anyway if you know what plan to apply in a certain position, you may calculate fewer lines.This course consists of 15 lectures. In every lecture I cover a certain motif which can be applied in any pawn endgame. At the end of the course I prepared a quiz for you.I designed this course for beginners and club players with FIDE rating from 1200 to 2000. But if you don’t have FIDE rating, this is not a problem and it shouldn’t stop you from taking this course. Even if you are a strong player, you may not know some tricks which can be applied in pawn endgames.

Leave behind old complicated courses and opt for the course that gets your hand dirty by not only teaching you the theoretical aspects of OOP PHP, but also gets you ready for the physical aspects as well.Here’s how object oriented programming blends with PHP to create something simple and beautiful.The idea behind object oriented programming or OOP is that it revolves around objects instead of actions. So, instead of manipulating the logic behind the object to change something, you instead manipulate the object itself. Let’s make it simpler – in OOP PHP, similar items can be clubbed as one object. This means codes that are similar are placed in one object. So, in case you wanted to change the items or modify them in any manner – you can simply modify or call the object (this will change or call everything that is under this object). You can also add subclasses, which share the characteristics of the object. This helps when you constantly require calling certain classes for modification.Learn to create an E-Commerce Website from scratch in PHP & MySQL, building an online shopping store in PHP & MySQL had never been easier from scratch before this course.

The state of California is changing their regulations so that self-driving car companies can test their cars without a human in the car to supervise.Welcome to Deep Reinforcement Learning 2.0!In this course, we will learn and implement a new incredibly smart AI model, called the Twin-Delayed DDPG, which combines state of the art techniques in Artificial Intelligence including continuous Double Deep Q-Learning, Policy Gradient, and Actor Critic. The model is so strong that for the first time in our courses, we are able to solve the most challenging virtual AI applications (training an ant/spider and a half humanoid to walk and run across a field).To approach this model the right way, we structured the course in three parts:Part 1: Fundamentals\nIn this part we will study all the fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence which will allow you to understand and master the AI of this course.

Although Rexx has the capability to issue commands to its host environment and to call programs and functions written in other languages, Rexx is also designed to be independent of its supporting system software when such commands are kept to\na minimum.Many applications are programmable by means of macros. Unfortunately, in the Unix world, almost every application has a different macro language. Since Rexx is essentially a character manipulation language, it could provide the macro language for all these applications, providing an easy-to-use and consistent interface across all applications. The best examples of such systems are on CMS such as IBM's mainframe operating system which was the birthplace of Rexx.Windows Programming for EveryoneThis course will teach you how to program on your Windows computer by building working programs using the Rexx programming language.Rexx is the Perfect Programming Language to learn quickly and easily.Rexx is easy to learn because its like English, uses variables that are typeless and can hold any kind of information, and it provides wonderful interactive tracing capability.You only need your Windows PC and a download of the free Rexx programming software to get started.Watch the lectures in full screen and high resolution mode for the best viewing experience, and download and review the source code file included with each lecture.Welcome to the most detailed and elaborate course about Mainframe on the whole internet.

Do you feel confused with CSS jargon like inheritance, specificity or the cascade?What if there was one resource, one place, where you could learn all the advanced and modern CSS techniques and properties you\'ve been reading about?Good news: there is!Welcome to ""Advanced CSS and Sass"", the most advanced, the most modern, and the most complete CSS course on the internet. It\'s everything you want in an advanced CSS course, and more.You will learn complex CSS animations, advanced responsive design techniques, flexbox layouts, Sass, CSS architecture, fundamental CSS concepts, and so much more.CSS - short for Cascading Style Sheets - is a ""programming language"" you use to turn your raw HTML pages into real beautiful websites.This course covers it all - we start at the very basics (What is CSS? How does it work? How do you use it)? and gradually dive in deeper and deeper. And we do this by showing both practical examples as well as the theory behind it.Getting started with CSS might look easy but there actually is a lot of depth to CSS - hence this course provides different ""Tracks"" or ""Entry points"" to exactly meet your demands and reflect you current knowledge level:The Basics Track: Start from scratch, learn CSS from the ground up. You start with lecture 1 and simply follow through to the end.The Advanced Track: You already know the CSS basics, you know what selectors are and how it works but you want to dive in deeper and learn some advanced features and usages.This course is for both beginners and seasoned developers that want to learn how to build responsive websites and user interfaces with modern HTML5 and CSS3+ technologies like Flexbox and CSS Grid as well as the Sass pre-compiler. This course includes hours of both learning & studying sections along with real life projects.

Although MATLAB which is more powerful software than SCILAB is a proprietary product, and to use it for personal (or) commercial purposes one needs to purchase a license, which is very expensive. SCILAB software is used for performing the numerical computation. It is used in all major scientific areas such as space, aeronautics, defense, finance, etc.SCILAB includes a free package called SCICOS (XCos) which provides the model-based environment for designing continuous or discrete systems. In this course, we have a separate chapter to explore the various functionalities available in XCos with the practical implementation of the system.SCILAB is matrix oriented just like MATLAB, so by using matrix-based computations for performing numerical computations, the length of code can be shortened significantly. In SCILAB we can do programming on neural network, image processing, fluid dynamics, numerical optimization, etc.Introduction and Background:MATLAB is the most popular software for numerical computation in the fields of mathematics, control systems, statistics, signal processing and other science fields in general. However, there are some free alternatives available for scientific research community and Scilab is at the top of that list.  Scilab is an open source, cross-platform numerical computational software and also a high-level, numerically oriented programming language.  For MATLAB user, it also has a built-in MATLAB translator which can help them in smooth transition from MATLAB to Scilab. Scilab is fully compatible with Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows platforms. This course however, only uses Scilab in Windows 10 environment.Who should take this course and why:This course is designed for beginners and I am confident that you will become an intermediate level expert in the use of Scilab. This course will be a pre-requisite for my future advanced courses on Scilab.

Here are some important notes before you take the plunge:In this course I\'ll take your intermediate C++ skills, buff them up a little and use them to make a Hack n Slash game using SDL2. You\'ll be taken through the entire process of making this game and given source code of the project at various checkpoints if you get lost along the way.We are going to learn basic game dev elements, such as game loop, animations, collisions, player input and AI. I\'m also going to boost your skills with Inheritance and Polymorphism to simplify a complex game structure down into a few short bits of game logic.At the end of the course you\'ll walk out with game dev experience and a little game you can expand on and even build up to a marketable game.Let\'s make a game!Learn to play lead guitar in the style of one of the most influential modern rock guitarists of all time. Slash’s brilliant and creative playing has influenced countless guitarists all over the world. He is truly one of the greats, and we can all be inspired and empowered through his playing.In these lessons you will learn all kinds of techniques, devices, scales, riffs, tricks, and soloing strategies in the style of Slash. Throughout the course you will be given a step by step breakdown of his style and playing techniques.Slash is one of the most ferocious and recognizable players of modern times. This is true not just because of his “look”, but also because of his timeless and melodic playing style, driving riffs, his songwriting abilities, and his uncanny knack for melody.His playing often draws from his influences of bluesy licks and riffs of the classic rock era of the early to mid 1970’s. Slash has stated that his influences include Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, and Angus Young.']",[''],"['3-6 months of Unreal Engine 4 experience is recommended, but everything is made on video so you can follow alongYou should be familiar with C++ (if, while, for, pointers, dynamic memory, classes, inheritance)Install either Visual Studio Community (2013) for Windows ORInstall XCode for Mac ORInstall CodeBlocks for LinuxNote: SDL2 is cross platform and can be done on Windows/Linux/Mac, however this course will be taught on Windows.

As governments around the world enact new laws and regulations about taxes, people that truly understand money know how to save (make) money with taxes. It’s the law of survival: you add a new element to the environment and the organisms within will adapt, adjust, or move to another area to preserve their life. And while taxes will help you preserve your financial life, your goal is not to focus on saving on taxes but on making money.Once you understand the fundamentals, changing your financial destiny becomes fairly simple to do. Simple doesn’t mean no work. It means that you know what paths you need to take to get to your destination.Successful, soundness, strong financial disciplines are not optional. For anyone. No matter their age, their income levels, their social status. Financial failure is not an option. It’s not an option to your future self, to your spouse, to your kids, to your co-workers, to your society, to your country, to the world. In any level. Not constantly seeking a solid foundation for your finances will lead to unavoidable pains in your life.People have been singing King David's Psalms for millennia. In early Christian times, monks would memorise all 150 Psalms and chant them every day. Benedict of Nursia arranged the Psalms into a schedule spread over a week. Gradually hymns and prayers were added, giving rise to what we now call the Divine Office or Liturgy of the Hours.The full Office was rather onerous, so in Medieval times a smaller schedule arose, designed to be manageable for people with day jobs and families as well as being shorter to copy out and memorise. This was placed under the patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is venerated as the spiritual mother of all Christians, stemming from Jesus' words on the cross, entrusting her to the care of the Beloved Apostle, John.The Gregorian Chant could date back to Jewish chant - there isn't much documentation, as the notation of chant came about later. The tunes are highly esteemed and there are even tales of the music being responsible for monks being able to live such austere lives.Language is the fish while culture is the water.Without water fish will die,it is the same for language and culture.So,If you think it is hard to learn Chinese,you should know the Chinese culture.If you think it is difficult to use Chinese,you should learn the Chinese culture .We have to find a way to learn Chinese more efficiently.Here is the course 'Learn Chinese from 50 most  essential traditional Chinese culture'We selected 50 articles and stories which can represent China.All of them are the bricks of Chinese culture.Each lecture has Chinese,Pinyin,and English to explain the culture.Create 3-dimensional surfacesCreate triangulated irregular networks (TIN) and modify rasters to 3D data Develop and analyze data for the geospatial analysis projectDesign color ramps for your dataCreate 3-dimensional surfacesCreate triangulated irregular networks (TIN) and modify rasters to 3D data Develop and analyze data for the geospatial analysis projectDesign color ramps for your dataUse the imagery in two different common types of analysis: NDVI and trained classificationPractice with tools to support image analysis using Raster Calculation and Spatial AnalystDevelop a large processing workflow in ModelBuilderUse products derived from digital elevation models""]",['Create 3-dimensional surfacesCreate triangulated irregular networks (TIN) and modify rasters to 3D data Develop and analyze data for the geospatial analysis projectDesign color ramps for your dataUse the imagery in two different common types of analysis: NDVI and trained classificationPractice with tools to support image analysis using Raster Calculation and Spatial AnalystDevelop a large processing workflow in ModelBuilderUse products derived from digital elevation models'],['Thinking of starting a business on the sideAlready have a side-hustleAwareness of Pitch (the difference between high sounds and low sounds)Awareness of the existence of the Latin LanguageBasic Pinyin50-100 Chinese words']

It's here!--------------------This is the best course online for mastering Typescript.Every other course online teaches you the basic syntax and features of Typescript, but only this course will show you how to apply Typescript on real projects, instructing you how to build large, successful projects through example.Typescript is a 'super-set' of Javascript.  That means that if you already know Javascript, you are ready to take this course.  Typescript adds in several important features to Javascript, including a type system.  This type system is designed to help you catch errors during development, rather than when you are running your code.  That means you'll be twice as productive by catching bugs earlier in development.  But besides the type system, Typescript also provides several tools for structuring large codebases and writing truly reusable code.Angular is an amazing JavaScript (TypeScript) framework which allows you to build small, medium or large Single-Page-Applications (SPAs). Since the code runs entirely in the browser, you can build user experiences which are way faster than traditional websites could ever be!The skills required to build such SPAs are in extremely high demand since this kind of web app is very popular and allows you to build almost mobile-like, highly reactive user experiences. Indeed most modern web applications are built as SPAs today!As the creator of the 5-star rated, BESTSELLING Angular course here on Udemy, I know what I'm talking about and I know what the core features of Angular are which you need to learn.It's my goal to allow you to focus on these core features to get the quickest and best introduction into Angular, you can find!Understand client-side web UI frameworksUse of Angular Material and Angular Flex-Layout for UI designUtilize the Ionic mobile application frameworkBuild mobile apps for multiple platforms with a single codebaseThe first two courses in this Specialization cover front-end frameworks: Bootstrap 4 and Angular.

In today's computer age, the ability to write code is becoming just as important as reading and writing.  From doing scientific work to manipulating data and creating applications and web resources, computer coding is everywhere.The Wolfram Language is an ideal candidate for your first language.  Even if you are seasoned in other languages, it is worthwhile to take a look at this powerful yet easy to learn language.  The structure of the language is such that once you understand a few basics, it becomes almost intuitive to guess at what new code should look like without having to explicitly learn it.  This sets it apart from so many other languages.The Wolfram Language is also unique in that it gives you access to information right inside of the coding environment.  It makes knowledge computable.  Through the Wolfram Language you will have access to an enormous amount of data and knowledge.In this course, we're going to teach you how to use the powerful graphics and animation tools available in Mathematica for prototyping ideas and visualizing data. While Mathematica has many built in functions for doing really amazing things, we feel that a good understanding of how to code frees you to be able to make just about anything. And so our focus in this course is programming using the Wolfram Language. To get you started off quickly, we will jump right in with plotting and animating, data and mathematical functions. After that, we will get into the nitty gritty details of programming with the Wolfram Language.In each lecture, we will introduce new concepts, and demonstrate use cases with interesting examples. You can download the lecture notebook and follow along with us, as the best way to learn to program is to get as much practice as possible. Each lecture is also accompanied by an exercise notebook. These notebooks provide a bunch of problems for you to work on and will really help to internalize the new material. You will get the most out of this course if you do all of the exercises.Do you ever wish you could know what someone is thinking? Or perhaps you want to improve your own non-verbal communication? Body language is a great way to gain insights into how others think and feel, as well improve your everyday communication with others.This body language course is based on scientifically-backed research, and is designed to teach you how to read people's nonverbal behavior and improve your own.Whether you are a business owner, parent, spouse, employee, human resources director, teacher or student, this course will change the way you interact with those around you.If you have ever interacted with another person, this course will be useful to you because our everyday interactions are filled with secret nonverbal cues just waiting to be uncovered.Why Is Body Language Important?""]",[''],"[""This course assumes that the student has access to a computer with an internet connection. The coding environment is Mathematica, which can be installed as a purchased product or free of charge as a web service that runs in the browser. The course deals with mathematical computing and some knowledge of basic algebra and calculus will be of help.No prior knowledge of computer programming is required.Familiarity with basic concepts in algebra and calculus is helpfulBuy Mathematica from Wolfram or your school's software portalComputer speakers""]"

There are many use-cases where you have to fetch the certain types of data based on any specific requirements of your projects. XQuery will make it very easy for you to query any data from the XML file.Currently every web site or web service offer support to XML. This course will give you the strong basic understanding of XML XQuery using practical implementation on screen & help you implement it in your web development projects.I designed this course for anyone including non-technical person. So if you are not a developer and still interested in learning about the XML XQuery & see how it works then this course is for you.This course is for Microsoft developers who want a well-rounded approach to XML on the entire Microsoft product-line.  It is based on my 19 years of consulting and teaching XML and B2B/Integration.   To be a well-rounded developer or architect, you need to be aware of all these features; and that\'s especially true for BizTalk and Integration Developers.In addition to learning XML, you will learn XPath, XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language - used to map XML to another XML or HTML), and XQuery. The course shows what is possible with the Microsoft .NET libraries, and what additional features are available by using the third party Saxonica .NET libraries.  You will learn how to create and understand XSD Schemas, and how to validate an XML file against a schema.The programming languages covered as they relate to XML are C#, PowerShell, and T-SQL.  You will learn how to read and write XML, and how to navigate and find elements and values in the XML, and how to modify the XML (for example, adding new elements or new attributes).\n\nIn Microsoft SQL Server, you will learn 1) how to use XML columns, 2) how to format relational data as XML using the ""For XML"" clause, and 3) how to take an XML file and query it in SQL, then store it into relational tables.']",[''],"['Knowledge of XMLKnowledge of Eclipse IDE will help but not requiredKnowledge of HTML will help but not requiredBasics of XMLBasics of HTMLBasics of InternetWhile not required, general knowledge of C# and Visual Studio would be usefulWhile not required, experience in some programming language would be usefulWhile not required, knowledge of HTML would be useful for one of the exericses']"

Thank You!  -""Practical Transformation Using XSLT and XPath"" is over 24 hours of instructor lecture, with hands-on exercises and solutions, of an intensive five-day training class.  The introduction/overview is free, the first two modules are free, the introduction of every other module is free, one additional lecture is free and the annexes are free: a total of 311 minutes of free preview content!This class overviews the entire scope of the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) 1.0 , XSLT 2.0 , the XML Path Language (XPath) 1.0  and XPath 2.0  W3C Recommendations, used for transforming structured information (e.g. XML to XML, XML to HTML, XML to XSL-FO, XML to text, etc.). The objectives of the course are to understand the role and utility of the Recommendations, to overview all the constructs of the Recommendations (this five-day delivery covers every element, every attribute, and every function), to design and develop XSLT scripts, and to efficiently navigate the available documentation and resources. The relationship of XSLT to XSL is explained, though details of XSL Formatting Object semantics are not included.This is a Udemy best-selling course. Here are some of the comments from other students:""Excellent instructor. The lessons are clear, practical and gradually increase the complexity. I had just a basic knowledge of XML and after this course I am learning a lot more.""""A very useful and unique insight into a lesser known area of Excel.
