algae,"on completing this course you will get a clear concept about soils and the various branches of this science. it will lay the foundation for more advanced topics and higher level courses in soil scienceunderstand how to implement and evaluate a variety of predictive data mining models in three different domains, each described as extended case studies: (1) harmful plant growth; (2) fraudulent transaction detection; and (3) stock market index changes.perform sophisticated data mining analyses using the ""data mining with r"" (dmwr) package and r software.have a greatly expanded understanding of the use of r software as a comprehensive data mining tool and platform.understand how to implement and evaluate supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning algorithms.students learn diversities of plants like algae, fungi, bryophytes, etc.","this course teaches the fundamental concepts of soil science. it includes 8 major topics - soil chemistry, soil mineralogy, soil organic matter, soil physics, soil biology, soil fertility, soil nutrient management, soil genesis & classification. this course will provide a basic understanding of all the key concepts and terminologies of every aspect of soil.case studies in data mining was originally taught as three separate online data mining courses. we examine three case studies which together present a broad-based tour of the basic and extended tasks of data mining in three different domains: (1) predicting algae blooms; (2) detecting fraudulent sales transactions; and (3) predicting stock market returns. the cumulative ""hands-on"" 3-course fifteen sessions showcase the use of luis torgo\'s amazingly useful ""data mining with r"" (dmwr) package and r software. everything that you see on-screen is included with the course: all of the r scripts; all of the data files and r objects used and/or referenced; as well as all of the r packages\' documentation. you can be new to r software and/or to data mining and be successful in completing the course. the first case study, predicting algae blooms, provides instruction regarding the many useful, unique data mining functions contained in the r software \'dmwr\' package. for the algae blooms prediction case, we specifically look at the tasks of data pre-processing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive model construction. for individuals completely new to r, the first two sessions of the algae blooms case (almost 4 hours of video and materials) provide an accelerated introduction to the use of r and rstudio and to basic techniques for inputting and outputting data and text. is the second extended data mining case study that showcases the dmwr (data mining with r) package. the case is specific but may be generalized to a common business problem: how does one sift through mountains of data (401,124 records, in this case) and identify suspicious data entries, or ""outliers""? the case problem is very unstructured, and walks through a wide variety of approaches and techniques in the attempt to discriminate the ""normal"", or ""ok"" transactions, from the abnormal, suspicious, or ""fraudulent"" transactions. this case presents a large number of alternative modeling approaches, some of which are appropriate for supervised, some for unsupervised, and some for semi-supervised data scenarios. the third extended case, is a data mining case study addressing the domain of automatic stock trading systems. these four sessions address the tasks of building an automated stock trading system based on prediction models that utilize daily stock quote data. the goal is to predict future returns for the s&p 500 market index. the resulting predictions are used together with a trading strategy to make decisions about generating market buy and sell orders. the case examines prediction problems that stem from the time ordering among data observations, that is, from the use of data. it also exemplifies the difficulties involved in translating model predictions into decisions and actions in the context of \'real-world\' business applications.in this course you have to learn about varieties of plants which is very much helpful for human beings, birds and animals. in which particular plant shows its own beauty and their scientific importance also. every plant have their own criteria. so i hope at the end of the course you all know about different varieties of plants.students aspiring to study agriculture or environmental sciences, farmers wanting to broaden their knowledge about soils,biology students like higher secondary, bachelor and master coursebsc botany students, msc botany, microbiology or any life science studentsstudents aspiring to study agriculture or environmental sciences, farmers wanting to broaden their knowledge about soils,biology students like higher secondary, bachelor and master coursebsc botany students, msc botany, microbiology or any life science studentsstudents aspiring to study agriculture or environmental sciences, farmers wanting to broaden their knowledge about soils,biology students like higher secondary, bachelor and master coursebsc botany students, msc botany, microbiology or any life science students","students aspiring to study agriculture or environmental sciences, farmers wanting to broaden their knowledge about soils,biology students like higher secondary, bachelor and master coursebsc botany students, msc botany, microbiology or any life science students","school level chemistry, physics and biology is all you need. curiosity to learn about how soils support life on our planetstudents will need to install no-cost r software and the no-cost rstudio ide (instructions are provided).any person can learn who want to learn botanical science"

in poor hire or improper assessment of abilities. in this course you will learn how to develop valid and reliable instruments to collect data.you will learn how to measure item reliability in the context of confirmatory factor analysis.you will be able to assess the validity of your constructs (by measuring convergent and discriminant validities).the course contains very detailed exercises, that are solved step by step, so that you can understand how to apply each step to your own models.researchers and students from all areas of study for which statistics and assessment instruments play an important role.explain the factors that contributed to the current opioid crisis.understand the pathophysiology of pain and its treatment, including what opioids are and how they work.understand

manufacturing principles.create adaptive toolpaths to remove material from designs efficiently.demonstrate simulation driven design (sdd) for new product development.the demand placed on today�s engineers goes above and beyond the job description. products have become complex and engineers are more frequently asked to leave specialized roles and to take on a wide variety of tasks that are beyond their traditional responsibilities.  these tasks are centered on form, fit, and function. engineers need to factor in broader concerns such as cost, procurement, sustainability, manufacturability, and serviceability. their role has moved away from an individual responsibility to working as part of a collaborative engineering team, executing tradeoffs with both engineering and business stakeholders to meet project goals. these trends have forced today�s engineers to broaden their skillset to be successful. engineers today are required to be on the cutting edge of design innovation. this means not only understanding engineering principles that govern the title and role, but also perfecting the toolsets needed to design and develop products.  through this

it is not a quick start guide to socket.io. there are loads of those all over the internet. you should definitely look elsewhere if you are wanting a 10 minute intro to the 3-4 things you need to know to make something quick. on the other hand, if you are looking to one of the most awesome javascript libraries in socket io you should stick around. like express and other javascript/node pieces,  it\'s getting passed over in the wave to learn just enough to get to the term ""full-stack developer."" my main goal is to help you figure out how to go from being a good developer to a great developer. understanding... not just knowing a few methods... of socketio is part of that!

finding shortest paths on huge maps and assembling genomes from millions of pieces.solve complex programming challenges using advanced techniques: maximum flow, linear programming, approximate algorithms, sat-solvers, streaming.this specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice. no other online course in algorithms even comes close to offering you a wealth of programming challenges that you may face at your next job interview. to prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in moocs. sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! for each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time � you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! it may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. the specialization contains two real-world projects: big networks and genome assembly. you will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between new york and san francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of dna and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.apply basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting and dynamic

\'hits-at-bat\' or estimating the likely total number of taxicabs in a strange city when one observes a certain sequence of numbered cabs pass a particular street corner over a 60 minute period. in addition to detailing half a dozen (sometimes amusing) \'real-world\' extended example applications, the course also explains in detail how to use existing r functions, and how to write your own r functions, to perform simulated inference estimates, including likelihoods and confidence intervals, and other cases of stochastic simulation. techniques to use r to generate different characteristics of various families of random variables are explained in detail. the course teaches skills to implement various approaches to simulate continuous and discrete random variable probability distribution

core ml for ios server side swift using vapor course overviewparsing or syntactic analysis is one of the first stages in designing and implementing a compiler. a well-designed syntax of your programming language is a big motivation why users would prefer and choose exactly your language.----------------------------------------------------------the problem with �parsers theory� in classic compiler schools and books is that this theory is often considered as �too advanced�, going right into complicated formal descriptions from the theory of computation and formal grammars. as a result students may lose an interest in building a compiler already at parsing stage.the opposite problem often seen in describing a parser is a superficial approach describing only manual (usually recursive descent) parsing, leaving the students with issues understanding the actual techniques behind the automated parsers.parsing or syntactic analysis is one of the first stages in designing and implementing a compiler. a well-designed syntax of your programming language is a big motivation why users would prefer and choose exactly your language.note: this is a practical class on building a manual recursive-descent parser. if you�re interested in parsing theory and automated algorithms you may also consider the [ parsing algorithms ] class.recursive descent parsers are the group of parsers which are widely used on practice in many production programming languages. in contrast with automated parsing algorithms, the manual implementation allows having full control over the parsing process, and handling complex constructs, which may not be possible in the automatic parsers.besides, implementing a full manual parser from scratch allows understanding and seeing this process from inside, demystifying internal structures, and turning building parsers into an interesting engineering task.install python and write your first programdescribe the basics of the python programming

to the world of commercial application development using lazarus or delphi.what you will learn:beginner level coders often have the same question; what�s the best way to get started in programming? it�s such a diverse world and there are so many new and exciting (or old and vital) languages that figuring out where to begin can be very bewildering. guess what? we have the solution. the simple, clean, structured pascal language is the best way to help you find your programming feet. its whole reason for existing is to teach good programming practices and standards. what are you waiting for? get learning!take your programming standards to the next levelmany people desire to lead but have never been exposed practically to leadership. as a result, their idea of leadership and how to lead is theoretical, based on learned concepts and studies. leadership is practical and the best way to understand it is to study leaders and see how they lead, the strategies they use, the tactics they use, how they handle various situations and how and why they fail, deducing important lessons for own leadership. this gives a leader a better understanding of what leadership is and how to lead.in the course, over 20 of the world�s greatest military generals and emperors of all time are profiled and studied, from shaka zulu, alexander the great, hannibal, genghis khan to commodus among others, giving the learner clear insights into what made these man standout as leaders and what made some to fail. the lessons derived are practical, direct and can be applied in any setting, just as they were applied by these outstanding leaders in times of both war and peace.design and implement an object-oriented program in the c++ language, including defining classes that encapsulate data

usually don�t mean supervised and unsupervised machine learning.these tasks are pretty trivial compared to what we think of ais doing - playing chess and go, driving cars, and beating video games at a superhuman level.reinforcement learning has recently become popular for doing all of that and more.much like deep learning, a lot of the theory was discovered in the 70s and 80s but it hasn�t been until recently that we�ve been able to observe first hand the amazing results that are possible.in 2016 we saw google�s alphago beat the world champion in go.we saw ais playing video games like doom and super mario.self-driving cars have started driving on real roads with other drivers and even carrying passengers (), all without human assistance.this course is all about the application of deep learning and neural networks to reinforcement learning.if you�ve taken my first reinforcement learning class, then you know that reinforcement learning is on the bleeding edge of what we can do with ai.specifically, the combination of deep learning with reinforcement learning has led to alphago beating a world champion in the strategy game go, it has led to self-driving cars, and it has led to machines that can play video games at a superhuman level.reinforcement learning has been around since the 70s but none of this has been possible until now.the world is changing at a very fast pace. the state of california is changing their regulations so that self-driving car companies can test their cars without a human in the car to supervise.welcome to deep reinforcement learning 2.0!in this course, we will learn and implement a new incredibly smart ai model, called the twin-delayed ddpg, which combines state of the art techniques in artificial intelligence including continuous double deep q-learning, policy gradient, and actor critic. the model is so strong that for the first time in our courses, we are able to solve the most challenging virtual ai applications (training an ant/spider and a half humanoid to walk and run across a field).to approach this model the right way, we structured the course in three parts:part 1: fundamentals\nin this part we will study all the fundamentals of artificial intelligence which will allow you to understand and master the ai of this course. these include q-learning, deep q-learning, policy gradient, actor-critic and more.build a reinforcement learning system for sequential decision making.understand the space of rl algorithms (temporal- difference learning, monte carlo, sarsa, q-learning, policy gradients, dyna, and more).understand how to formalize your task as a reinforcement learning problem, and how to begin implementing a solution.  understand how rl fits under the broader umbrella of machine learning, and how it complements deep learning, supervised and unsupervised learning the reinforcement learning specialization consists of 4 courses exploring the power of adaptive learning systems and artificial intelligence (ai).harnessing the full potential of artificial intelligence requires adaptive learning systems. learn how reinforcement learning (rl) solutions help solve real-world problems through trial-and-error interaction by implementing a complete rl solution from beginning to end.by the end of this specialization, learners will understand the foundations of much of modern probabilistic artificial intelligence (ai) and be prepared to take more advanced courses or to apply ai tools and ideas to real-world problems. this content will focus on �small-scale� problems in order to understand the foundations of reinforcement learning, as taught by world-renowned experts at the university of alberta, faculty of science.the tools learned in this specialization can be applied to

and use in personal computers without pay for a license (freely available to use). although matlab which is more powerful software than scilab is a proprietary product, and to use it for personal (or) commercial purposes one needs to purchase a license, which is very expensive. scilab software is used for performing the numerical computation. it is used in all major scientific areas such as space, aeronautics, defense, finance, etc.scilab includes a free package called scicos (xcos) which provides the model-based environment for designing continuous or discrete systems. in this course, we have a separate chapter to explore the various functionalities available in xcos with the practical implementation of the system.scilab is matrix oriented just like matlab, so by using matrix-based computations for performing numerical computations, the length of code can be shortened significantly. in scilab we can do programming on neural network, image processing, fluid dynamics, numerical optimization, etc.introduction and background:matlab is the most popular software for numerical computation in the fields of mathematics, control systems, statistics, signal processing and other science fields in general. however, there are some free alternatives available for scientific research community and scilab is at the top of that list.  scilab is an open source, cross-platform numerical computational software and also a high-level, numerically oriented programming language.  for matlab user, it also has a built-in matlab translator which can help them in smooth transition from matlab to scilab. scilab is fully compatible with linux, mac os x, and windows platforms. this course however, only uses scilab in windows 10 environment.who should take this course and why:this course is designed for beginners and i am confident that you will become an intermediate level expert in the use of scilab. this course will be a pre-requisite for my future advanced courses on scilab. therefore, it is a good opportunity for my students to get familiar with the software if you are really planning to use this software for future research or educational career.rahsdr480 is a system-level course on software-defined radio. this course will be a foundation stone to help you get a telecommunication, defense, and space industry job. this course covers all fundamental concepts

been nearly 4 years since tensorflow was released, and the library has evolved to its official second version.tensorflow is google\'s library for deep learning and artificial intelligence.deep learning has been responsible for some amazing achievements recently, such as:generating beautiful, photo-realistic images of people and things that never existed (gans)beating world champions in the strategy game go, and complex video games like cs:go and dota 2 (deep reinforcement learning)self-driving cars (computer vision)this course will get you started in building your first artificial neural network using deep learning techniques. following my previous course on logistic regression, we take this basic building block, and build full-on non-linear neural networks right out of the gate using python and numpy. all the materials for this course are free.we extend the previous binary classification model to multiple classes using the softmax function, and we derive the very important training method called ""backpropagation"" using first principles. i show you how to code backpropagation in numpy, first ""the slow way"", and then ""the fast way"" using numpy features.next, we implement a neural network using google\'s new tensorflow library.you should take this course if you are interested in starting your journey toward becoming a master at deep learning, or if you are interested in machine learning and data science in general. we go beyond basic models like logistic regression and linear regression and i show you something that .best
